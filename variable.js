//what are variables
//variables are ways to store data in memory/ram as program/app is running
//in javascript we declare variable using var,let or const keywords
var age = 90;
var age = 90;
// var is globally scopped
// let and const are block{} scopped
let username = "victor";
const PI = 8.142;
//we use =(equal) to assign values to our variables
//when the application is running we can access thes values using the variable name

console.log(age); //90
console.log(age); //90
console.log(username); // victor
console.log(PI * 2); //6.284
username = "james"; //
PI = 4.2; //trying to reassign to a constant variable -typeError

// variable naming rules in javascript -- variables are case sensitive
// variable naming conventions(CS)
/**
 * name should be meaningful/descriptive - make code readable and easy to maintain
 * do not use the same for a variable and a function within the same scope
 * naming styles/notation-> camelCaseNotation, snake_case_notation, kebab-case-notation

//what is an API --e.g. what daraja api is used for
